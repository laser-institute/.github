## The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute 

A significant portion of the LASER Institute consists of Learning Labs, which are designed to provide scholars with a conceptual understanding of, and applied experience with, analyzing educational data using **foundational-skills** (e.g., data wrangling, visualization) and advanced techniques such as  **machine-learning**, **text-mining**, and **network-analysis**. Each GitHub repository pinned below contains four learning labs consisting of guided and independent activities including:
1.  **Overview Presentations** and a code-along to introduce basic concepts and R skills. [[example](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-4/sna-lab-4-slides.html)] 
2.  **Essential Readings** to deepen your understanding of core concepts. [[example](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-4/sna-lab-4-readings.html)]
3.  **Tutorials or Case Studies** for guided practice analyzing educational data with R. [[example](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-4/sna-lab-4-case-study-key.html)]
4.  **Learning Lab Badges** that you can earn by demonstrating basic competencies. [[example](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-4/sna-lab-4-badge.html)]
